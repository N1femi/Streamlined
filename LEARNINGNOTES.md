### Used to keep track of concepts I've learned or encountered
*Keeping track allows me to actively retain and be able to look back and confirm past misunderstandings or absent knowledge :)*

#

#### CSS:
- `:root` enabled configuration for global variables

- `.selector:hover .anotherSelector {...}` when selector is hovered `.anotherSelector` will be changed accordingly, relationship must be parent -> child or sibling


#### JavaScript:
- `elem.dataset` every element can have a special attribute prefixed with *"data-"* this would give a full list too

- `iterable.slice(startIndex, endIndex)` basically makes a shallow copy of whatever window is specified from the between the two indexes

- `chrome.storage` 3 types: `sync`, `session`, and `local` with each their own purposes

#### Additional Notes:
- Instead of using multiple pages and switching through them, having an `active` keyword in the different **divs** allowed me to toggle which one's have `display: none`
