# A Learner's Notes...
### Used to keep track of concepts I've learned or encountered
*Keeping track allows me to actively retain and be able to look back and confirm past misunderstandings or absent knowledge :)*

#

#### CSS:
- `:root` enabled configuration for global variables


#### JavaScript:
- `elem.dataset` every element can have a special attribute prefixed with *"data-"* this would give a full list too


#### Additional Notes:
- Instead of using multiple pages and switching through them, having an `active` keyword in the different **divs** allowed me to toggle which one's have `display: none`
